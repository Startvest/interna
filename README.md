## What is interna?

Interna is a solution designed to bridge the gap between students who have undergone internships and students who are looking for internships by giving them a social community where previous interns can share their internship experiences with interested students and guide them through the internship process.

### Mission

We are bridging the gap between learning and the industry, by providing a community of interns sharing their experiences.

### Vision

To be the go-to platform for students looking to gain practical experiences in the industry as early as possible
