          THINGS I WISH I KNEW BEFORE BECOMING A DEVELOPER \n\n

          1. Programming Is All About Having The Right Resources And Selecting The Best Tool For The Job \n

          2. Imposter Syndrome Is Normal At Every Stage.

          3. Cheating is Perfectly Acceptable. Like most programmers, I frequently turn to Google to find solutions.

          4. There is A Significant Difference Between A Capital And a Lowercase Letter. It took me a while to get used to 
          noticing minute variations between seemingly identical symbols, 
          and until you do, it can be quite frustrating.

          In retrospect, I'm actually glad I was so naive in the beginning. Because I knew so little back then, I was motivated to think critically about everything I learned later on.
